            <h3><u>Chapter 1: The City and the Silence</u></h3>
            <p>Detective Hardcastle shuddered when he heard the knock at his door. Midnight on a Saturday, and somebody was looking for a gumshoe? It smelled like trouble, because if he had learned one thing in his time as a private eye, it was that all the city's ghosts came out at night.</p>
            <p><i>I hope you're not looking for a fight</i>, he thought to himself. <i>Because if you are, you found it.</i></p>
